# 🧠 Machine Learning Classification Project – Passenger Transport Prediction
🧾 Overview
This project focuses on a binary classification task: predicting whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension. It follows a complete machine learning pipeline — data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and basic tuning. The primary model used is a Random Forest Classifier.

📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features:

Column	Description
PassengerId	Unique identifier for each passenger
HomePlanet	Planet passenger is coming from
CryoSleep	Whether the passenger opted for cryo sleep
Cabin	Cabin number and deck info
Destination	Destination planet
Age	Passenger’s age
VIP	Whether the passenger is a VIP
RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck	Spending on amenities
Name	Full name of passenger
Transported	Target variable (True/False)

🔄 Step-by-Step Workflow
1. 📦 Library Imports
Used libraries include:

pandas, numpy for data handling

matplotlib, seaborn for visualizations

sklearn for preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation

2. 📊 Data Loading
python
Copy
Edit
data = pd.read_csv("train.csv")
Initial inspection with head(), info(), and isnull().sum().

3. 🧹 Missing Value Treatment
Categorical missing values filled using SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent').

Numerical missing values filled using SimpleImputer(strategy='median').

4. 🛠 Feature Engineering
Cabin column split into three features: Cabin_Deck, Cabin_Num, Cabin_Side

python
Copy
Edit
data[['Cabin_Deck', 'Cabin_Num', 'Cabin_Side']] = data['Cabin'].str.split('/', expand=True)
Dropped unnecessary columns: Name, PassengerId, Cabin

5. 🔢 Label Encoding
Categorical columns converted to numerical format using LabelEncoder:

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
for col in data.select_dtypes(include='object').columns:
    data[col] = le.fit_transform(data[col])
6. ✂️ Train-Test Split
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X = data.drop("Transported", axis=1)
y = data["Transported"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
7. 🌳 Model Training
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
8. 📈 Model Evaluation
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
Metrics include:

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

9. 🔍 Feature Importance Plot
python
Copy
Edit
importance_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'feature': X_train.columns,
    'importance': model.feature_importances_
}).sort_values('importance', ascending=False)

plt.title('Feature Importances')
sns.barplot(data=importance_df.head(10), x='importance', y='feature')
10. 📐 Hyperparameter Tuning (Decision Tree Depth)
Custom function max_depth_error() visualizes how varying max_depth affects performance.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

def max_depth_error():
    error_rate = []
    for depth in range(1, 20):
        tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=depth)
        tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
        y_pred = tree.predict(X_test)
        error = 1 - tree.score(X_test, y_test)
        error_rate.append(error)

    plt.plot(range(1, 20), error_rate, marker='o')
    plt.xlabel("Max Depth")
    plt.ylabel("Error Rate")
    plt.title("Max Depth vs Error Rate")

Since I can't access the content of the weatherAUS.xls file directly at the moment, I can’t accurately update the README to reflect the real dataset without seeing its structure and features.

However, if you can tell me:

The target variable you’re predicting (e.g., rainfall tomorrow?)

Key columns/features in the dataset

Type of model used (classification or regression)

Steps you've taken in the notebook (cleaning, imputation, modeling, etc.)

…I can generate a detailed and accurate README for you right away. Would you like to describe the dataset briefly so I can proceed?
